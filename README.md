# Heart Disease Risk Prediction : Logistic Regression
----
## Introductory Context
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, claiming approximately 18 million lives each year, the World Health Organization reports. Predictive models such as logistic regression may allow early identification of patients at risk by analyzing clinical characteristics such as age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. This not only improves treatment outcomes but also optimizes resource allocation in healthcare settings. In this repository, logistic regression is implemented on the Heart Disease dataset, a real-world UCI repository collection of 303 patient records with 14 features and a binary objective (1 for presence of disease, 0 for absence). We'll train models, visualize boundaries, apply regularization, and explore deployment through Amazon SageMaker to mimic a production process.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
